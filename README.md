MusicMappr
==========

<b>What does it do?</b>

MusicMappr finds chunks of songs that are similar, and clusters them accordingly. You can visualize these clusters and play them back at will. This is for music lovers who are curious about the structures inherent to their favorite songs.

<b>How does it work?</b>

MusicMappr uses a hodge-podge of HTML5 features as well as some clustering and visualization techniques from machine learning. Using the WebAudio API, it extracts raw samples from a song. Then, it divides those samples into chunks and performs a fourier transform on each chunk to extract frequency data (dividing the work into multiple WebWorkers to speed up the process). Then, MusicMappr uses the T-SNE algorithm to visualize differences between the high dimensional fourier features in 2-d space. Finally, it runs K-means clustering to show the clusters that arise from T-SNE.

<b>How do I get it to work?</b>

MusicMappr is a work in progress. Right now it is confirmed to work on Chrome and Firefox, but no other browsers. Make sure you have the latest version of one of these browsers.

<b>Where can I try it?</b>
